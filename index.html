        <p>Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Why not indeed! There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Hello, little man. I will destroy you!</p>
        <p>Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.</p>
        <p>As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. But existing is basically all I do!</p>
